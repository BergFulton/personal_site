#Traceybergfulton.com Overhaul
A refresh for my own personal site, done in a 2 week sprint.
I wanted to have the site up and running responsively for Museum Computer Network conference 2015.

##What is this? 
The old version of traceybergfulton.com was...well...busted. 

##What changed? 
Lots! The site now has:
* A responsive layout
* An up-to-date picture
* An up-to-date resume
* A listing of my speaking activities

##I want to go to there. 
Great. Visit [www.traceybergfulton.com](www.traceybergfulton.com).

##I dig your layout, can I use it? 
Sure. Fork the code and have at it. A little shoutout in your README or 
on twitter would be nice, but don't worry about it. If you use my images,
please credit me. They're my artistic work, and they're kind of important to me?
