# Traceybergfulton.com Overhaul 2.0
In this version, updated December 2, 2017, I've cleaned up some copy, added new information, and changed some styling. 

## What is this? 
The old version of traceybergfulton.com was...well...busted. I've also changed jobs and refocused my career, so it is definitely time for a refresh. 

## What changed? 
Lots! The site now has:
* An up-to-date resume.
* Updated speaking and publication activities. 
* A newer, more readable font. 
* A new color scheme. 

## I want to go to there. 
Great. Visit [www.traceybergfulton.com](http://www.traceybergfulton.com).

## I dig your layout, can I use it? 
Sure. Fork the code and have at it. A little shoutout in your README or 
on Twitter would be nice, but don't worry about it. If you use my images,
please credit me. They're my artistic work, and they're pretty important to me.
