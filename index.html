          <h3 class="section_header">Hi there.</h3>
          <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
          <p>I'm Tracey Berg-Fulton. I'm a creative technologist, and doer of things. What does that mean? It means I combine my love of making (and occasionally breaking) things, a passion for history, and a growing relationship with the web to build things for people. I love to code, create, write, talk, and, support users and teammates.</p>
          <p>I earned my BA at <a href="http://www.otterbein.edu">Otterbein University</a>, and my graduate degree from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>. I also completed the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree</a>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I spend lots of time running silly distances, resulting in a hard-fought <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=1167&rid=425"><s>4:25</s></a> <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=3457&rid=336">4:13</a> marathon PR. When I'm not running, I'm picking things up and putting them down as a competitive powerlifter. I photograph the old fashioned way, using a trusty Holga 120s I've owned since high school. You can see some of my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/traceyberg">Flickr</a>. My other side project is restoring a 1959 Nash Metropolitan under the tutelage of my dad. Read about the Metropolitan's issues and progress <a href="https://github.com/BergFulton/metropolitan/issues">on GitHub.</a></p>
          <p>I get way too excited about Antiques Roadshow, baking, and fuzzy dogs. I cry at weddings, listen to old records, and generally keep my New Year's Resolutions.</p>
          <p>So, that's me. Now, what can we do together?</p>

        <h3>Things I've done.</h3>
        <p>I'm currently enjoying life as Community Manager for <a href="https://www.authenticjobs.com">Authentic Jobs</a>. I help solve problems for customers, manage social media and e-mail marketing campaigns, and generally try to employers and job seekers find eachother.</p>
        <p>Before coming to Authentic Jobs, I was collections database associate and provenance researcher at the Carnegie Museum of Art. You can read about my work on the Art Tracks project on the <a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/category/series/art-tracks/">CMOA blog</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at CMOA, I was data manager for a tech start up in Pittsburgh, where I supervised a large team of interns, part-timers, and full timers to process data, do data QA, and create a descriptive taxonomy.</p>
        <p>From 2012 until 2017, I served as Web Chair for the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums (RC-AAM), now the Collections Stewardship Professional Network of the American Alliance of Museums (CS-AAM). I maintained and updated the former rcaam.org domain before building, designing, and launching a new site at <a href="http://www.collectionsstewardship.org">collectionsstewardship.org</a> and training and supporting my successor.</p>
