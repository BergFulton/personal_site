          <h3 class="section_header">Who are you?</h3>
          <p>Hi there! I'm Tracey Berg-Fulton <i>(pronouns: she/her, Gàidhlig: i/ise)</i>. I'm a frontend engineer, and doer of things. What does that mean? It means I combine a love of making stuff, overwhelming curiosity, and a healthy dose of "sure, why not" to build a better internet for humans. I love to code, create, write, talk, and support users and my team.</p>
         <p>I earned my BA at <a href="http://www.otterbein.edu">Otterbein University</a>, and my graduate degree from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>. I then completed the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree</a>. I am also currently learning Gàidhlig at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig via distance learning.</p>

          <p>I spend lots of time running silly distances, resulting in a hard-won <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=1167&rid=425"><s>4:25</s></a> <s><a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=3457&rid=336">4:13</a></s> <strong><a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=7483&rid=269">4:11</a></strong> marathon PR. </p>
          <p>When I'm not running, I'm picking things up and putting them down as a competitive powerlifter. I photograph the old fashioned way, using a trusty Holga 120s I've owned since high school. You can see some of my photos over on my <a href="gallery.html">gallery page</a>. I also spend a lot of weekends at car cruises showing my 1959 Metropolitan that I restored with my father.</p>
          <p>I get way too excited about Antiques Roadshow, baking, and fuzzy dogs. I cry at weddings, listen to old records, and generally keep my New Year's Resolutions.</p>
          <p>So, that's me. Now, what can we do together?</p>

      <h3>What kind of work do you want to do?</h3>
      <p>Great question! My skills and interests are wide ranging, and I enjoy a challenge.</p>
      <p>I am most interested in writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and building digital experiences with empathy, joy, and care. Creating interfaces, prototypes, and sites is my happy place.</p>
      <p>I am not particularly picky about frameworks or technologies: I firmly believe that each project and each team should choose the tools and approaches that best fit the needs of the team & their users.</p>

        <p>Get the full story by downloading my <a href="pdf/Tracey_Berg-Fulton_Resume_June_24.pdf" target="PDF">resume</a>.</p>
        <p>I am currently a Frontend Engineer at Lumen Learning, where I focus on UI development in a React TS framework using styled components.</p>
        <p>Before Lumen, I was a Frontend Engineer at the National Kidney Foundation, where I worked on <a href="https://www.kidney.org" target="_blank">kidney.org</a> using Drupal, jQuery, and SCSS.</p>
        <p>Prior to joining the National Kidney Foundation, I was Content Lead at <a href="http://www.cottonbureau.com">Cotton Bureau</a>. I did fun things like write site copy and micro-copy, work on designer-focused campaigns and communication, and create transactional emails. I sat firmly between the product team and the marketing team to fulfill their content needs.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at Cotton Bureau, I was Customer & Community Lead at <a href="https://www.authenticjobs.com">Authentic Jobs</a>. At Authentic Jobs, I solved problems for our awesome customers, managed social media and e-mail marketing campaigns, and helped employers and job seekers find eachother.</p>
        <p>I also worked as collections database associate and provenance researcher at the Carnegie Museum of Art, working on the Art Tracks provenance data project. You can read about my work on Art Tracks on the <a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/category/series/art-tracks/">CMOA blog</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at CMOA, I was data manager for a tech start up, where I supervised a team of interns, part-timers, and full-timers who processed data, did data QA, and created a descriptive taxonomy.</p>
        <p>From 2012 until 2017, I served as Web Chair for the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums (RC-AAM), now the Collections Stewardship Professional Network of the American Alliance of Museums (CS-AAM). I maintained and updated the former rcaam.org domain before building, designing, and launching a new site at <a href="http://www.collectionsstewardship.org">collectionsstewardship.org</a> and training and supporting my successor.</p>

        <h3>FAQ's</h3>
        <p class="subsub">Can you relocate?</p>
        <p>I bet your city is awesome, and I'd love to visit, but <span class="hiring_affirm">I am only looking for fully remote work</span> right now.
        <p class="subsub">Have you worked remotely before?</p>
        <p>Yes! I've worked on fully and partially distributed teams since 2016. My preference is for full-time remote work, with opportunities to get together as a team.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Coffee or tea?</p>
        <p>Oh, yes please!</p>
        <p class="subsub">What is your favorite color?</p>
        <p>I'm partial to a good blue, or a hot pink.</p>
        <p class="subsub">What are you learning right now?</p>
        <p>Right now I'm reading up on the new React 19 release, exploring fluid type & layout in my professional development time, and doing a course on web components.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Is the Hokey Pokey *really* what it's all about?</p>
        <p>Yes, definitely.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Early riser or night owl?</p>
        <p>I am on Team Early Riser. I'm up around 5AM everyday to walk my dog, exercise, do chores, and anything else that needs done.</p>
        <p class="subsub">You talk a lot about diabetes on your social media. What's up with that?</p>
        <p>I'm celebrating nearly 30 years of living with Type 1 Diabetes, and advocating for the needs of the Type 1 community is important to me. When I found the T1 online community, it was life changing (THERE ARE OTHERS!), and so I want to be that discovery for someone else. I want to break down diabetes stigma wherever it exists.</p>
