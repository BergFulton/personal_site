          <h3 class="section_header">Hi there.</h3>
          <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
          <p>I'm Tracey Berg-Fulton. I'm a creative technologist, and doer of things. What does that mean? It means I combine my love of making (and occasionally breaking) things, a passion for history, and a growing relationship with the web to build things for people. I love to code, create, write, talk, and, support users and teammates.</p>
          <p>I earned my BA at <a href="http://www.otterbein.edu">Otterbein University</a>, and my graduate degree from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>. I also completed the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree</a>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I spend lots of time running silly distances, resulting in a hard-fought <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=1167&rid=425"><s>4:25</s></a> <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=3457&rid=336">4:13</a> marathon PR. When I'm not running, I'm picking things up and putting them down as a competitive powerlifter. I photograph the old fashioned way, using a trusty Holga 120s I've owned since high school. You can see some of my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/traceyberg">Flickr</a>. My other side project is restoring a 1959 Nash Metropolitan under the tutelage of my dad. Read about the Metropolitan's issues and progress <a href="https://github.com/BergFulton/metropolitan/issues">on GitHub.</a></p>
          <p>I get way too excited about Antiques Roadshow, baking, and fuzzy dogs. I cry at weddings, listen to old records, and generally keep my New Year's Resolutions.</p>
          <p>So, that's me. Now, what can we do together?</p>

        <h3>Things I've done.</h3>
        <p>My most recent roll was Content Lead at <a href="http://www.cottonbureau.com">Cotton Bureau</a>. I did fun things like write site copy and micro-copy, work on designer-focused campaigns and communication, and create transactional emails. I sat firmly between the product team and the marketing team to fulfill their content needs.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at Cotton Bureau, I was Customer & Community lead at <a href="https://www.authenticjobs.com">Authentic Jobs</a>. I solved problems for customers, managed social media and e-mail marketing campaigns, and helped employers and job seekers find eachother.</p>
        <p>I also worked as collections database associate and provenance researcher at the Carnegie Museum of Art, working on the Art Tracks provenance data project. You can read about my work on Art Tracks on the <a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/category/series/art-tracks/">CMOA blog</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at CMOA, I was data manager for a tech start up, where I supervised a team of interns, part-timers, and full-timers who processed data, did data QA, and created a descriptive taxonomy.</p>
        <p>From 2012 until 2017, I served as Web Chair for the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums (RC-AAM), now the Collections Stewardship Professional Network of the American Alliance of Museums (CS-AAM). I maintained and updated the former rcaam.org domain before building, designing, and launching a new site at <a href="http://www.collectionsstewardship.org">collectionsstewardship.org</a> and training and supporting my successor.</p>

        <h3>FAQ's</h3>
        <p class="faqs">Can you relocate?</p>
        <p>I'm sure your city is awesome, for many reasons, I cannot relocate right now. Let's talk about remote work, though!</p>
        <p class="faqs">Have you worked remotely before?</p>
        <p>Yes. I've worked on fully distributed teams, and partially distributed teams. I've also done the standard 9-5 onsite thing too.</p>
        <p class="faqs">What is your favorite color?</p>
        <p>I'm partial to a good blue, or a hot pink.</p>
        <p class="faqs">Tabs or spaces?</p>
        <p>Not going there. This is what style guides are for, and if you've got one of those, I'll do whatever fits.</p>
        <p class="faqs">Is the Hokey Pokey *really* what it's all about?</p>
        <p>Yes, definitely.</p>
        <p class="faqs">What are you learning right now?</p>
        <p>There's always another framework, right? I'm diving into ReactJS right now.</p>
