          <h3 class="section_header">Who are you?</h3>
          <p>Hi there! I'm Tracey Berg-Fulton, and I'm the Web Manager at the <a href="http://www.kidney.org">National Kidney Foundation</a>. I'm a developer, and doer of things. What does that mean? It means I combine a love of making stuff, overwhelming curiosity, and a healthy dose of "sure, why not" to build a better internet for humans. I love to code, create, write, talk, and support users and my team.</p>
          <p>Learning is a lifelong process, and I've been privileged to have had the opportunity to learn and share my knowledge with <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/pittsburgh">Girl Develop It! Pittsburgh</a>, where I voluteered as an instructor, organizer, and TA. Earlier in my <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/af44744f-ceea-43ac-b3ff-426d9d519d43">curiosity voyage</a>, I earned my BA at <a href="http://www.otterbein.edu">Otterbein University</a>, and my graduate degree from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>. I also completed the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001">Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree</a>.</p>

          <p>I spend lots of time running silly distances, resulting in a hard-won <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=1167&rid=425"><s>4:25</s></a> <s><a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=3457&rid=336">4:13</a></s> <strong><a href="https://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=7483&rid=269">4:11</a></strong> marathon PR. </p>
          <p>When I'm not running, I'm picking things up and putting them down as a competitive powerlifter. I photograph the old fashioned way, using a trusty Holga 120s I've owned since high school. You can see some of my photos on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/traceyberg">Flickr</a>. My other side project is restoring a 1959 Nash Metropolitan under the tutelage of my dad. Read about the Metropolitan's issues and progress <a href="https://github.com/BergFulton/metropolitan/issues">on GitHub.</a></p>
          <p>I get way too excited about Antiques Roadshow, baking, and fuzzy dogs. I cry at weddings, listen to old records, and generally keep my New Year's Resolutions.</p>
          <p>So, that's me. Now, what can we do together?</p>

        <h3>What did you do before?</h3>
        <p>Get the full story by downloading my <a href="pdf/TraceyBergFulton_Resume_12_2018.pdf" target="PDF">resume</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to joining the National Kidney Foundation, I was Content Lead at <a href="http://www.cottonbureau.com">Cotton Bureau</a>. I did fun things like write site copy and micro-copy, work on designer-focused campaigns and communication, and create transactional emails. I sat firmly between the product team and the marketing team to fulfill their content needs.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at Cotton Bureau, I was Customer & Community Lead at <a href="https://www.authenticjobs.com">Authentic Jobs</a>. At AuthenticJobs, I solved problems for our awesome customers, managed social media and e-mail marketing campaigns, and helped employers and job seekers find eachother.</p>
        <p>I also worked as collections database associate and provenance researcher at the Carnegie Museum of Art, working on the Art Tracks provenance data project. You can read about my work on Art Tracks on the <a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/category/series/art-tracks/">CMOA blog</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to working at CMOA, I was data manager for a tech start up, where I supervised a team of interns, part-timers, and full-timers who processed data, did data QA, and created a descriptive taxonomy.</p>
        <p>From 2012 until 2017, I served as Web Chair for the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums (RC-AAM), now the Collections Stewardship Professional Network of the American Alliance of Museums (CS-AAM). I maintained and updated the former rcaam.org domain before building, designing, and launching a new site at <a href="http://www.collectionsstewardship.org">collectionsstewardship.org</a> and training and supporting my successor.</p>

        <h3>FAQ's</h3>
        <p class="subsub">Can you relocate?</p>
        <p>I bet your city is awesome, and I'd love to visit, but for many reasons I cannot relocate out of Pittsburgh right now. Let's talk about remote work, though!</p>
        <p class="subsub">Have you worked remotely before?</p>
        <p>Yes! I've worked on fully and partially distributed teams. I've done the 9-5 onsite thing, too. My preference is for full-time remote work, with opportunities to get together as a team periodically.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Coffee or tea?</p>
        <p>Oh, yes please!</p>
        <p class="subsub">What is your favorite color?</p>
        <p>I'm partial to a good blue, or a hot pink.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Tabs or spaces?</p>
        <p>Not touching this with a 10 foot pole, but also, I'll do whatever fits the team's style. It's not a big thing.</p>
        <p class="subsub">What are you learning right now?</p>
        <p>I'm diving into ReactJS.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Got a favorite Slack emoji?</p>
        <p>:partyparrot:, without a doubt. While I love the variations, the classic party parrot is right in every situation. If we're talking about stock emoji, probably :sparkle:</p>
        <p class="subsub">Is the Hokey Pokey *really* what it's all about?</p>
        <p>Yes, definitely.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Mac or PC?</p>
        <p>Right now I work on an 11in MacBook Air. It's a great machine, in a totally adorable package. I've worked in Mac and PC environments, and I have a strong preference for Mac, but hey, everything's a learning opportunity.</p>
        <p class="subsub">Early riser or night owl?</p>
        <p>I am on Team Early Riser. I'm up around 5AM everyday to walk my dog, exercise, do chores, and anything else that needs done.</p>
        <p class="subsub">You talk a lot about diabetes. What's up with that?</p>
        <p>I'm celebrating 23 years of Type 1 Diabetes, and advocating for the needs of the Type 1 community is important to me. When I found the T1 online community, it was life changing (THERE ARE OTHERS!), and so I want to be that discovery for someone else. I want to dispell myths and stereotypes whenever I can.</p>
