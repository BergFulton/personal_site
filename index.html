            <h3 class="section_header">Hi there.</h3>
            <p> I'm Tracey Berg-Fulton, and I'm a creative technologist. You're probably wondering what that means? Well, it means I combine my love of making (and breaking) things, a passion for history, and a geeky relationship with the web to do cool things for people.</p>
            <p> I am from Pittsburgh, but have had the pleasure of moving around quite a bit, living in Belfast, Glasgow, and Columbus, OH. I earned my BA in art and journalism from <a href="http://www.otterbein.edu">Otterbein University</a>, and my graduate degree in art history from the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>.</p>

            <p> In my spare time, I'm a runner, and the proud owner of a <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=1167&rid=425"><s>4:25</s></a> <a href="http://www.mtecresults.com/runner/show?race=3457&rid=336">4:13</a> marathon PR. I also still photograph the old fashioned way, using my trusty 15 year old Holga 120s. You can see my photography work on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/traceyberg">Flickr</a> page.</p>

            <p> I get way too excited about Antiques Roadshow, 19th century tiling, early sanitary ceramics (aka the history of the loo), baking, and fuzzy bearded dogs. I cry at weddings, listen to old records, and generally keep my New Year's Resolutions.</p>

            <p>So, that's me. Now, what cool stuff can we do together?</p>

        <h3>Things I've done.</h3>
                <p>I'm currently a collections database associate and provenance researcher at the Carnegie Museum of Art. You can read about my work on the Art Tracks project on the <a href="http://blog.cmoa.org/category/series/art-tracks/">CMOA blog</a>.</p>
                <p>Prior to working at CMOA, I was data manager for a tech start up in Pittsburgh, where I supervised a large team of interns, part-timers, and full timers to process data, do data QA, and create a descriptive taxonomy.</p>
                <p>I was also registrar at the August Wilson Center. I have also been in private practice as a contract registrar, doing everything from installation, to toilet repair, to shipping and condition reporting.</p>
                <p>Since 2012, I have served as Web Chair for the Registrars Committee of the American Alliance of Museums (RC-AAM). I maintain the <a href="http://www.rcaam.org">rcaam.org</a> domain, supported by an amazing team of volunteers and peers. The site is undergoing a responsive redesign, so watch that space!</p>
